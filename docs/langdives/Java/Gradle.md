# **Gradle**

## **What is Gradle ?**

Gradle is a modern, powerful build automation tool used for building, testing, and deploying applications. It is particularly popular in Java and Android projects due to its flexibility and performance. Gradle uses a `Groovy/Kotlin-based DSL` to configure and manage builds, allowing for easy customization.


## **How Gradle Works ?**

Gradle organizes builds using a *Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)* of tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed only when necessary.

!!! abstract "The Build process has Three phases"

    !!! info "Initialization Phase"
        - Identifies the participating projects (useful for multi-project builds).
        - Creates the build environment (root project and sub-projects).
    
    !!! info "Configuration Phase"
        - Configures all tasks in the project(s).
        - Resolves dependencies, configures plugins, and defines task order.

    !!! info "Execution Phase"
        - Executes the required tasks in the correct sequence according to the task dependencies.


## **Gradle Build**

Gradle build configuration is done in the `build.gradle` file. This file uses Groovy or Kotlin DSL to describe:

- Dependencies required for the project.
- Repositories where the dependencies will be fetched from.
- Plugins to extend functionality.
- Custom tasks to automate various steps.

!!! example "`build.gradle` Example"
    ```groovy
    plugins {
        id 'java'        // Apply Java plugin
        id 'application' // Allow running the app from CLI
    }

    repositories {
        mavenCentral() // Use Maven Central for dependencies
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'  // Runtime dependency
        testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'  // Test dependency
    }

    application {
        mainClass = 'com.example.UnderTheHood'  // Entry point of the app
    }
    ```


## **Understanding `build.gradle`**

!!! abstract "Plugins Section"
    ```groovy
    plugins {
        id 'java'
        id 'application'
    }
    ```

    - This section applies Gradle plugins. 
    - Gradle provides an ecosystem of plugins to extend functionality
    - `java`: Adds support for Java projects.
    - `application`: Allows running applications directly from Gradle with `gradle run`.
    - `maven-publish`: Publishes artifacts to Maven repositories.
    - `android`: Used for Android app development.
    - In the example, the `java` plugin sets up the project to be built as a Java application.

!!! abstract "Repositories Section"
    ```groovy
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    ```

    - This section tells Gradle where to download dependencies from.
    - `mavenCentral()` is a popular repository that hosts many open-source libraries.

!!! abstract "Dependencies Section"
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'
        testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
    }
    ```

    - Gradle manages external libraries required by your project.
    - `implementation`: Adds a runtime dependency.
    - `testImplementation`: Adds a dependency for testing purposes.

!!! abstract "Application Configuration"
    ```groovy
    application {
        mainClass = 'com.example.UnderTheHood'
    }
    ```

    - This specifies the main class to be run when using the `gradle run` command.


## **Dependency Management**

Gradle allows automatic dependency management. Dependencies (like libraries and frameworks) are fetched from repositories such as:

- **Maven Central**: A public repository.
- **JCenter**: (Now deprecated) Another widely used repository.
- **Custom repositories**: Can be local or remote (e.g., Artifactory, Nexus).

Gradle resolves dependencies in the following order:

- **Local Cache**: Located in `~/.gradle/caches/`.
- **Local Maven Repository**: If `mavenLocal()` is specified (`~/.m2/repository/`).
- **Remote Repositories**: Downloads dependencies from Maven Central or other remote repositories if not found locally.

```bash title="Offline Mode"
# Forces Gradle to use only the local cache 
# and does not try to access remote repositories.
gradle build --offline
```


## **Custom Tasks**

Gradle allows developers to create custom tasks to automate specific workflows.

???+ example "Custom Tasks Example"
    ```groovy title="Create Custom Task"
    task uth {
        doLast {
            println 'Hello, UnderTheHood ;)'
        }
    }
    ```

    ```bash title="Run the Custom task"
    gradle uth
    ```

    ``` title="Output"
    Hello, UnderTheHood ;)
    ```

    Custom tasks can be chained and made dependent on other tasks:

    ```groovy
    task compileCode {
        dependsOn clean
        doLast {
            println 'Compiling code...'
        }
    }
    ```


## **Publishing Artifacts**

You can publish your project’s artifacts (e.g., JARs) to Maven Local or Remote repositories using the `maven-publish` plugin.

!!! example "Local Maven Publish Example"
    ```groovy title="Apply Maven Publish Plugin"
    plugins {
        id 'maven-publish'
    }
    ```

    ```groovy title="Configure Publishing in build.gradle"
    publishing {
        publications {
            mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
                from components.java
            }
        }
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()  // Publish to local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository)
        }
    }
    ```


    ```bash title="Publish the Artifact"
    # This will install the JAR into your local Maven repository.
    gradle publishToMavenLocal
    ```
   


## **Gradle Project Structure**

``` title="Gradle recommended standard directory structure"
/my-project
│
├── build.gradle          # Build configuration file
├── settings.gradle       # Project settings file
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java          # Source code
│   └── test
│       └── java          # Unit tests
└── build                 # Output directory (JAR, WAR)
```

- **`src/main/java`**: Contains the application source code.
- **`src/test/java`**: Contains unit test code.
- **`build/`**: Contains compiled artifacts (like JARs).

Gradle supports multi-module projects where different modules are part of the same build.

``` title="Example Multi-Project Structure"
/root-project
│
├── build.gradle            # Root project configuration
├── settings.gradle         # Lists sub-projects
├── module-1/
│   └── build.gradle        # Configuration for module 1
└── module-2/
    └── build.gradle        # Configuration for module 2
```

```groovy title="settings.gradle"
rootProject.name = 'multi-project-example'
include 'module-1', 'module-2'
```

```bash title="Running the build"
# This will build all modules in the correct order.
gradle build
```


## **Gradle Wrapper**

The Gradle Wrapper is a feature that allows a project to include a specific Gradle version along with scripts to execute builds. This ensures that anyone working on the project uses the same Gradle version without requiring a manual installation.

The Gradle Wrapper consists of:

  - A set of shell scripts (Unix: `gradlew`, Windows: `gradlew.bat`).
  - A configuration file (`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`) that specifies the Gradle version to use.
  - A JAR file (`gradle-wrapper.jar`) that downloads Gradle if needed.

### **Why Use Wrapper ?**

  - Ensures that all team members use the same Gradle version.
  - Simplifies onboarding – contributors do not need to install Gradle manually.
  - Useful for CI/CD pipelines to avoid version mismatches.
  - Works offline after the first download by caching Gradle versions locally.


## **Gradle Commands**

Here are some essential Gradle commands for working with projects:

| **Command**             | **Description**                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `gradle init`           | Initializes a new Gradle project.                 |
| `gradle build`          | Compiles, tests, and packages the project.        |
| `gradle run`            | Runs the application (if using the Application plugin). |
| `gradle clean`          | Removes the `build/` directory for a fresh build. |
| `gradle tasks`          | Lists all available tasks.                        |
| `gradle test`           | Runs all tests in the project.                    |
| `gradle publish`        | Publishes artifacts to Maven repositories.        |


## **Performance Benefits**

Gradle is designed for speed and efficiency

- **Incremental Builds**: Only recompiles changed files, speeding up builds.
- **Build Cache**: Gradle reuses outputs of previous builds if nothing has changed.
- **Parallel Execution**: Gradle can execute tasks in parallel when there are no dependencies between them.


## **Summary**

Gradle provides several advantages for modern projects

- **Flexibility**: Customizable tasks and plugins allow you to tailor builds to your needs.
- **Speed**: Incremental builds and build caching reduce build times.
- **Dependency Management**: Easy integration with Maven repositories.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for multi-project builds and large teams.
- **Extensibility**: Works well for Java, Android, and multi-language projects.
