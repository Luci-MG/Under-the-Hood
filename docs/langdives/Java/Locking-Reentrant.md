# **ReentrantLock Locking**

Locking is an essential concept in multithreaded programming to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety. When multiple threads access shared resources, locks ensure that only one thread accesses the critical section at a time. Java offers various locking mechanisms, from synchronized blocks to explicit locks like `ReentrantLock`.

We will cover ReentrantLock in this article.

## **What is `ReentrantLock` ?**

The `ReentrantLock` class, introduced in Java 5, offers more control over thread synchronization than the `synchronized` keyword. It allows for advanced locking techniques such as fairness policies, tryLock, and interruptible locks. Letâ€™s explore everything about `ReentrantLock`, including its use cases, internal mechanisms, and best practices.

`ReentrantLock` is a concrete class in the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package that implements the Lock interface. 

!!! note
    - Fine-grained control over locking, including fair and unfair locks.
    - The ability for a thread to re-acquire a lock it already holds without blocking (hence the term "reentrant").
    - Explicit unlocking, unlike the `synchronized` keyword, which automatically releases the lock when the block exits.

??? example "ReentrantLock Example"
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        public void increment() {
            lock.lock();  // Acquire the lock
            try {
                count++;
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();  // Release the lock
            }
        }

        public int getCount() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                return count;
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Counter counter = new Counter();

            Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
            });

            Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
            });

            t1.start();
            t2.start();
            t1.join();
            t2.join();

            System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());  // Output: 2000
        }
    }
    ```


## **How it Works Internally ?**

Lock Acquisition: When a thread calls `lock()`, it tries to acquire the lock. If the lock is available, the thread proceeds otherwise, it blocks until the lock becomes available.

Reentrancy: A thread that holds the lock can acquire the lock again without blocking. This is useful when a thread *nters a method that also calls another synchronized method or block that requires the same lock.

**Fair vs Unfair Locking:**

   - **Fair Lock**: Threads are granted access in the order they requested the lock. this lock ensures that the longest-waiting thread gets the lock first, the main advantage is this avoids thread starvation and the disadvantage is it may have lower performence due to increased overhead
   ```java
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Fair lock
   ```

   - **Unfair Lock**: Threads may skip the queue if the lock is released, improving performance but reducing fairness the main advantage is better throughout because threads are allowed to "Jump the queue" but disadvantage is it can lead to thread starvation where some threads may not get chance to execute.
   ```java
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();  // Unfair lock (default)
   ```


## **Advanced Locking Techniques**

### **tryLock()**

The `tryLock()` method attempts to acquire the lock without blocking. It returns true if the lock is acquired, otherwise false.

??? example "`tryLock()` Example"
    ```java
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        try {
            // Perform task
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Could not acquire lock, doing something else...");
    }
    ```
!!! tip "When to use ?"
     When you want to avoid blocking indefinitely if the lock is not available.


### **tryLock with Timeout**

The `tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method waits for a specific amount of time to acquire the lock.

??? example "`tryLock()` Timeout Example"
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

    if (lock.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        try {
            // Perform task
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Could not acquire lock within timeout.");
    }
    ```

!!! tip "When to use ?"
     When waiting indefinitely is not practical, such as network operations or I/O tasks.


### **Interruptible Lock Acquisition**

The `lockInterruptibly()` method allows a thread to acquire the lock but respond to interrupts while waiting.

??? example "`lockInterruptibly` Example"
    ```java
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly();  // Wait for lock, but respond to interrupts
        try {
            // Perform task
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Thread was interrupted.");
    }
    ```

!!! tip "When to use ?"
     Use when a thread needs to be interrupted while waiting for a lock.


## **Behavior**

A reentrant lock means that the same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without blocking itself. However, the thread must release the lock the same number of times to fully unlock it.


??? example "Behavior Example"
    ```java
    class ReentrantExample {
        private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        public void outerMethod() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                System.out.println("In outer method");
                innerMethod();
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }

        public void innerMethod() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                System.out.println("In inner method");
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    !!! info "Explanation"
         In this example, `outerMethod` calls `innerMethod`, and both methods acquire the same lock. This works without issues because `ReentrantLock` allows **reentrant locking**.


## **Condition Variables**

The `Condition` interface (associated with a `ReentrantLock`) allows a thread to wait for a condition to be met before proceeding. It provides better control than the traditional `wait()`/`notify()`.

??? example "Condition Variables Example"
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

    class ConditionExample {
        private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
        private boolean ready = false;

        public void awaitCondition() throws InterruptedException {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                while (!ready) {
                    condition.await();  // Wait for signal
                }
                System.out.println("Condition met, proceeding...");
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }

        public void signalCondition() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                ready = true;
                condition.signal();  // Signal waiting thread
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    }
    ```


## **Performance**

ReentrantLock has more overhead than `synchronized` due to fairness policies and explicit lock management, Use `synchronized` for simple scenarios, use reentrantLock for more complex locking requirements(eg: tryLock, fairness).

## **Summary**

`ReentrantLock` is a flexible locking mechanism in Java that offers advanced synchronization features beyond `synchronized`. It provides reentrant locking, fairness policies (fair and unfair locks), and explicit lock management. Key methods include `lock()`, `tryLock()` (non-blocking lock acquisition), `tryLock` with timeout, and `lockInterruptibly()` (responds to interrupts). ReentrantLock supports reentrant behavior, allowing the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times, and uses condition variables for fine-grained thread coordination. While it provides greater control, it incurs more overhead than `synchronized` and should be used for complex locking scenarios requiring features like fairness or timeout.
