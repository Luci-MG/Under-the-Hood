# **KISS Principle**

## **What ?**

The KISS Principle stands for *"Keep It Simple, Stupid"*. It’s a design principle that emphasizes simplicity, stating that systems and code work best if they are kept simple rather than made unnecessarily complex. The main idea is to avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complications, which can introduce more bugs, make the code harder to maintain, and increase development time.

KISS encourages developers to create code or solutions that are easy to understand, maintain, and modify. The idea is not to use complicated approaches or unnecessary abstractions when a simpler, more straightforward approach will do.

!!! tip ""
    “Simple” here doesn’t mean incomplete or simplistic it means clear, focused, and straightforward.


## **When to Use ?**
- When you’re writing code that other developers (or future you) will need to understand.
- In code that needs to be maintainable over time.
- For small to medium-sized projects, where simplicity ensures agility.
- When performance and maintainability are both important.
- When solving common, straightforward problems (CRUD operations, data validation, etc.).


## **Why to Use ?**
- Improves code readability as Simple code is easier to read and understand.
- Reduces bugs as The fewer moving parts, the fewer the chances of introducing errors.
- Facilitates maintenance as Developers can modify simple code more easily.
- Encourages reusability as Simple, well-factored code is more likely to be reusable.
- Reduces development time as Simple code can be implemented and tested faster.


## **Where Not to Use ?**

While simplicity is valuable, there are situations where the KISS principle might not apply fully. Over-simplifying can sometimes lead to problems.

- Systems like distributed architectures or cryptographic algorithms require a level of complexity. Oversimplifying might compromise functionality or security.
- In some cases, optimizations (like using caching or multi-threading) introduce complexity but are essential for performance. Blindly following KISS might result in suboptimal code.
- In large-scale software projects, abstractions (even though they introduce some complexity) are necessary to manage dependencies and maintain modularity.
- Security systems often require additional layers of checks and validation that might seem complex. Simplifying such code could introduce vulnerabilities.


## **How to Use in Practice ?**

- Implement the most straightforward solution to a problem first.
- If the code grows complex, break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Don’t use design patterns or abstractions unless they add real value.
- Use standard, well-known patterns unless there is a strong reason to deviate.
- Clear names for variables, methods, and classes contribute to simplicity.


## **How to Use Example ?**

Let's Consider a example where we want to check if a number is even or odd.

??? danger "Non-KISS Complex Code"
    ```java
    public class NumberUtils {
        public static boolean isEven(int number) {
            return isDivisibleByTwo(number);
        }

        private static boolean isDivisibleByTwo(int number) {
            if (number % 2 == 0) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Is 4 even? " + isEven(4));
        }
    }
    ```
    ???+ info "Explanation"
        - This version introduces unnecessary complexity by creating a separate method `isDivisibleByTwo`.
        - It complicates the readability without adding value.
        - While technically correct, the design violates the KISS principle because the same functionality could have been achieved more simply.

??? success "KISS Simpler Code"
    ```java
    public class NumberUtils {
        public static boolean isEven(int number) {
            return number % 2 == 0;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Is 4 even? " + isEven(4));
        }
    }
    ```

    ???+ info "Explanation"
        - This version keeps things simple and easy to understand. 
        - The code is self-explanatory without unnecessary indirection.
        - It follows the KISS principle by doing the task in the simplest way possible while still being clear and functional.


## **Summary**

The KISS principle encourages developers to create simple, maintainable, and readable code, it means avoiding unnecessary complexity. However, KISS must be balanced some projects or scenarios require complexity to meet performance, modularity, or security needs. In the end, applying KISS is about striking the right balance making the solution as simple as possible, but not simpler than necessary.
