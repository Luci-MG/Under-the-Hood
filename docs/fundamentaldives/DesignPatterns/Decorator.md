# **Decorator**

## **What ?**

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to add functionality to objects without subclassing and in scenarios where multiple combinations of behaviors are required.

This pattern is used to attach additional responsibilities or behaviors to an object dynamically. It wraps the original object, adding new behavior while keeping the object’s interface intact. A decorator class has a reference to the original object and implements the same interface.

!!! info "Key Concepts"
    - **Component**: The interface or abstract class that defines the original object.
    - **ConcreteComponent**: The actual object that implements the `Component` interface.
    - **Decorator**: An abstract class that implements the `Component` interface and holds a reference to a `Component` object.
    - **Concrete Decorators**: Subclasses of the `Decorator` that add specific functionalities.


## **When to Use ?**

- When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and without altering their structure.
- When you want to extend the functionality of an object at runtime, without changing the class.
- When multiple combinations of responsibilities are needed, and subclassing would result in too many subclasses.
- When you want to keep the original class unchanged but extend its behavior transparently.


## **Where Not to Use ?**

- If too many layers of decorators are required, it can make code complex and difficult to debug.
- When performance is a concern, as the decorator adds overhead with each layer.
- If the object’s behavior doesn’t need to change dynamically, then simpler design patterns like inheritance or composition might suffice.
- In cases where direct modification to the existing class is possible, decorators might be overkill.


## **Advantages**

- Open for extension, closed for modification New functionalities can be added without altering existing code.
- More flexible than inheritance. It allows the combination of behaviors at runtime.
- Helps achieve single responsibility principle since each decorator adds only one type of behavior.


## **Disadvantages**

- Complexity increases with a large number of decorators.
- Debugging can be challenging because you need to trace through multiple layers of decorators.


## **How to Apply ?**

??? example "Simple Example"

    Let's consider an example where we are building a coffee shop. Different types of coffees can be enhanced with add-ons like milk, sugar, etc. Using the decorator pattern, we can apply these add-ons dynamically without subclassing.

    ```java
    // Step 1: Component Interface
    public interface Coffee {
        String getDescription();
        double getCost();
    }

    // Step 2: ConcreteComponent (Basic Coffee)
    public class BasicCoffee implements Coffee {
        @Override
        public String getDescription() {
            return "Basic Coffee";
        }

        @Override
        public double getCost() {
            return 2.0;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Decorator (Abstract)
    public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
        protected Coffee coffee; // The object being decorated

        public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
            this.coffee = coffee;
        }

        public String getDescription() {
            return coffee.getDescription();
        }

        public double getCost() {
            return coffee.getCost();
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Concrete Decorators (e.g., Milk, Sugar)
    public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
        public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
            super(coffee);
        }

        @Override
        public String getDescription() {
            return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
        }

        @Override
        public double getCost() {
            return coffee.getCost() + 0.5;
        }
    }

    public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
        public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
            super(coffee);
        }

        @Override
        public String getDescription() {
            return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
        }

        @Override
        public double getCost() {
            return coffee.getCost() + 0.2;
        }
    }

    // Step 5: Usage
    public class CoffeeShop {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Coffee coffee = new BasicCoffee();
            System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

            coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
            System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

            coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
            System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());
        }
    }
    ```

    ``` title="Output"
    Basic Coffee $2.0
    Basic Coffee, Milk $2.5
    Basic Coffee, Milk, Sugar $2.7
    ```


??? example "Spring Boot Example"

    In Spring Boot, the decorator pattern can be used in scenarios such as logging, monitoring, or security checks. You can implement a decorator pattern to enhance service classes without changing their core logic. Here's an example where we decorate a service class to add logging functionality.

    ```java title="Component Interface (Service Layer)"
    public interface UserService {
        String getUserDetails(String userId);
    }
    ```

    ```java title="Concrete Component"
    @Service
    public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
        @Override
        public String getUserDetails(String userId) {
            return "User details for " + userId;
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java title="Decorator"
    @Service
    public class LoggingUserService implements UserService {

        private final UserService userService;

        public LoggingUserService(UserService userService) {
            this.userService = userService;
        }

        @Override
        public String getUserDetails(String userId) {
            System.out.println("Fetching details for user: " + userId);
            return userService.getUserDetails(userId);
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java title="Configuration to Use Decorator"
    @Configuration
    public class ServiceConfig {

        @Bean
        public UserService userService(UserServiceImpl userServiceImpl) {
            return new LoggingUserService(userServiceImpl);
        }
    }
    ```

    ???+ info "How it Works in Spring Boot"
        - `UserServiceImpl` provides the basic functionality.
        - `LoggingUserService` acts as a decorator, adding logging before calling the original method.
        - Spring’s **DI (Dependency Injection)** ensures that the decorated service is injected wherever needed.

## **Summary**

The Decorator Pattern is a powerful and flexible way to enhance objects with additional behaviors dynamically without altering their structure. It shines in scenarios requiring combinations of behaviors and helps maintain clean, modular code. 

In Spring Boot, it can be used for decorating services with additional features like logging, security, or metrics, allowing these aspects to remain separate from the core business logic.

This pattern should be used thoughtfully since excessive use can introduce complexity and make debugging difficult. However, when applied correctly, it ensures that code remains extensible and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and Open Closed Principle.
